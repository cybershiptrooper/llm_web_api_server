## setting up
It is advised to use conda 
```
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.9
conda activate <env_name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## running the code

```
python main.py
```

## running tests

If you have pytest installed, you can simply run `pytest`. Else, you can use `python runtests.py`.
